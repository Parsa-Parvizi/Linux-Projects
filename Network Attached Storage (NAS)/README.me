Add backup capability: Add automatic data backup capability.
Add security capabilities: Apply additional security measures such as file encryption and access restrictions.
Use advanced NAS software: Use advanced NAS software such as OpenMediaVault or FreeNAS, which offer more features.
Limitations:

Performance: NAS performance may depend on the computer hardware and the number of hard drives.
Power consumption: Older computers may consume more power than commercial NAS devices.
Maintenance: Requires maintenance and updates of the operating system and related software.
