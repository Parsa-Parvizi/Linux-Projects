# Note:
# 1. This is a very basic example.
# 2. You'll need a GSM modem compatible with the Raspberry Pi.
# 3. You'll need to install necessary libraries (e.g., pyserial) for interacting with the GSM modem.
# 4. This script requires extensive modifications for a functional Pi Phone.
# 5. For a touch screen interface, you'll need to use libraries like `touchscreen` and `kivy`.

# This project involves several complexities:
# *   GSM modem communication protocols
#   *   Call handling and voice processing
#   *   Touch screen interface development
#   *   Power management
#   *   Hardware integration

# This script provides a starting point. You'll need to research and implement the necessary components 
# to build a functional Pi Phone.

# This project is highly challenging and may require significant effort and expertise.
