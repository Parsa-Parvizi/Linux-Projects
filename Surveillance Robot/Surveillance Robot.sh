# Note: This is a simplified example. You'll need to:
# 1. Install necessary libraries (e.g., RPi.GPIO)
# 2. Configure the Pi camera correctly
# 3. Implement proper motor control for your robot hardware
# 4. Add error handling and safety mechanisms

# For live streaming, consider using tools like:
# * Motion: Open-source video surveillance software
# * VLC: For streaming video over the network
# * GStreamer: A powerful multimedia framework

# This script provides a basic framework. You'll need to adapt and expand it 
# based on your specific hardware and requirements.
