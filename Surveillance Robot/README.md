Description:

Functions:
capture_image(): Takes a picture using the raspistill command.
record_video(): Record a video using the raspivid command.
move_forward(), move_backward(), move_left(), move_right(): These functions are for controlling the robot's movement. Note: These parts need to be replaced with actual control commands for your robot hardware.
Main loop (while true; do ... done): This loop allows the user to enter commands and control the robot.
Remote control: The user can enter commands via the terminal to make the robot take pictures, record videos, and move.
Implementation steps:

Install the required software:
Bash

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install RPi.GPIO
Hardware connection: Connect the Pi camera to the Raspberry Pi and connect the robot hardware properly.
Configure the Pi camera: Configure the Pi camera settings using the raspiconfig tool or via configuration files.
Implement motion control: Replace the code with actual control commands for your robot hardware.
Add more capabilities: Add capabilities such as motion detection, object tracking, and sending notifications.
Considerations:

Security: Use appropriate security measures to protect your robot and its data.
Power consumption: Optimize power consumption to increase the robot's runtime on a single charge.
Hardware limitations: Consider and do not exceed the limitations of the robot's hardware.
Laws and regulations: Make sure that your robot's use complies with local laws and regulations.
Note: This script is only a prototype and requires a deeper knowledge of electronics, programming,
and robotics to create a fully-fledged surveillance robot.
This project is an exciting challenge that will help you improve your skills in Linux, Python, and robotics.
